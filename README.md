# Deep Learning Exercises
## Basic Exercises
1. **Exercise_Basic_0_HelloWorld**: Check the installation of Tensorflow is successful.<br>
2. **Exercise_Basic_1_ImagePreprocessing**: A simple instruction of the ImageDataGenerator for image preprocessing.<br>
3. **Exercise_Basic_2_VGG16(build)**: Build the VGG16 ConvNet from script and load the pre-trained VGG16.<br>
4. **Exercise_Basic_3_VGG16_with_bottleneckfeatures**: Treat VGG16 ConvNet as a feature extract. Extract the images bottleneck features based on a pre-trained VGG16 ConvNet. The bottleneck features will be fed into a fully connected network for classification training. <br>
5. **Exercise_Basic_4_VGG16_fine_turning**: Fine-tuning the top layers and the last 4 convolution layers. Sometimes, the Keras and tf.keras API are not compatible.<br>
6. **Exercise_Basic_5_ResNet50(build1)**: One way to build the ResNet50 from script.<br>
7. **Exercise_Basic_6_ResNet50(build2)_SIGNS_DATASET**: Another way to build the ResNet50 from script. Apply the network for a multiclass classification problem.<br>
8. **Exercise_Autoencoder_ImageDenoising**: An example of applying the autoencoder to do image denoising. 

## Advanced Exercises
1. **FaceDetection(MTCNN)_pretrained**: Apply the pretrained MTCNN to detect the Face in an image.
2. **Yolo2(build)**: Coursera project. Apply Yolo2 algorithm for object detection.
